# Methods of Applied Mathematics
My own personal notes and solutions to the Methods of Applied Mathematics by Francis B. Hildebrand. 

This is a hobby where I type up the notes in Latex and add to it over time. Not only will it be notes from the book, but mixed in are my own notes from my experience/coursework over the years.

I will contribute to this once a week, starting the week of July 14th, 2025.
